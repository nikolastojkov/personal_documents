# Nikola Stojkov - Skopje based PHP Developer by day, StarCraft pro by night.
## Personal Statement
Hi, my name is Nikola and I'm a (mostly) PHP Developer. I love taking initiative in projects, love documenting projects, and, Laravel. I've tried transitioning to other languages and platforms, but I somehow always get back with PHP. I'm a hard, honest, and competent worker that is currently looking for a new place to call home.

... I also love dark humor.
